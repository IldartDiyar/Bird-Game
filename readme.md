# Bird Game

This is a simple JavaScript game that uses HTML and CSS for the UI. The game features a bird that the player can control using the space key to avoid obstacles and score points by passing through gaps between the obstacles. The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or goes out of bounds. The player can restart the game by clicking on a restart button.
Game Logic

The game uses JavaScript to handle the game logic, which includes keeping track of the player's score and elapsed time, displaying messages when the game is over, and allowing the player to pause the game by pressing the P key. The program also implements a life system in which the player starts with three lives, loses a life when the bird collides with an obstacle, and can continue playing if there are any lives left.
